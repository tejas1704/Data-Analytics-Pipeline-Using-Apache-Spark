# Data Analytics Pipeline Using Apache Spark

This project involves    
1. Using data analytics knowledge (word frequency, word-co-occurrence) and machine learning skills, performed multi-class                      classification of text data using Apache Spark.  
2. Built a data pipeline using  
   -  Data from sources such as NY Times articles using the APIs provided by the data sources.  
   -  Split the data into training and test data set.  
   -  Extract features that will determine the class or category of the article {politics, sports, business, movies}  
   -  Build a model for classification using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.  
   -  Assess the accuracy using a query text or new article for each new “category”  
   -  Compared the classification accuracy of these two classification algorithms, for a given text data set.
