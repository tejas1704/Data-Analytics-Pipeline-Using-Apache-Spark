How should we explain the fact that President Trump got away with making 2,140 false or misleading claims during his initial year in office?Both the left, in “America’s First Postmodern President” (written by Jeet Heer in The New Republic last summer), and the right, in “Donald Trump is the First President to Turn Postmodernism Against Itself” (written by David Ernst in The Federalist a year ago), have argued that Trump, without knowing the first thing about, say, Michel Foucault, is an avatar of the rejection of objective truth.Postmodernists, Heer wrote, describe a world whereAlong parallel lines, Ernst wrote,Scholars of contemporary philosophy argue that postmodernism does not dispute the existence of truth, per se, but rather seeks to interrogate the sources and interests of those making assertions of truth. As Casey Williams wrote in The Stone in The Times last April:It is not usually the job of political journalists to analyze postmodernism, so I turned to some scholars who are devoted to the subject.Trump’s “truths,” as Alan Schrift, a professor of philosophy at Grinnell College, pointed out,Put in the most straightforward terms, Johanna Oksala, a professor of social science and cultural studies at the Pratt Institute, responded by email to my inquiry:For something to be objectively true, Oksala wrote,In the Trump era, the core concept of truth has become deeply politicized and among Trump supporters there is scant appetite for “a rigorous peer-review process.” Andrew Cutrofello, a professor of philosophy at Loyola University Chicago, argues this point in an email:For some scholars, the attempt to link Trump’s lies — his falsehoods, his prevarications, his exaggerations, his duplicity, his “truthful hyperbole” — with postmodernism grows out of a misperception of the term.Todd May, a professor of philosophy and religion at Clemson, wrote by email thatIn “The Postmodern Condition,” Lyotard conducted a full-scale assault on the idea of a grand narrative as well as an assault on established norms. He wrote: “Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives. … Postmodern knowledge is not simply a tool of the authorities; it refines our sensitivity to differences and reinforces our ability to tolerate the incommensurable.”Daniel Dennett, a professor of philosophy at Tufts, has given much thought to the current state of events. “We’re entering a period of epistemological murk and uncertainty that we’ve not experienced since the Middle Ages,” he told The Guardian. In a 1998 essay, “Postmodernism and Truth,” Dennett explains why, in his view, objective truth is in fact something real, verifiable and of vast importance:Dennett adamantly rejects “a slide into some form of relativism.” He argues that while “it is true that past scientific orthodoxies have themselves inspired policies that hindsight reveals to be seriously flawed” and that “the methods of science aren’t foolproof,” it is also true thatTrump’s utter indifference to the truth, what some of his critics have come to call his “normlessness,” is intensely alarming to many Washington analysts.Never before have we had a president, E.J. Dionne, Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann write in their book, “One Nation After Trump,”They continue:Observing that “Trump has violated these basic understandings of how our democracy works in an unprecedented way,” Dionne, Mann and Ornstein go on:William M. Kurtines, Jacob Gewirtz and Jacob L. Lamb draw attention to the link between normlessness and moral disorder. In the Handbook of Moral Behavior and Development (Vol. 3), they write, “Durkheim identified anomie — a condition of normlessness or moral deregulation — as a moral disease more likely to afflict the top than the bottom of society.”Wealth, according to Durkheim,Trump’s status and wealth have allowed him to ignore limits, norms, rules and regulations and have created a vicious circle — as violations of customary norms go unpunished, such violations become ever more widespread.Gary Gutting, an emeritus professor of philosophy at Notre Dame, focuses on the crucial role of power in postmodernism — the power to defy norms and the power to determine the veracity of competing claims. He emailed me:There was a period, Stephen Greenblatt, a professor of the humanities at Harvard said by email, whenTo these earlier advocates of postmodernism,This view, however, “was eviscerated by philosophers like Bernard Williams and has, I think, virtually no current standing.”David Bromwich, a professor of English at Yale, contended thatInstead, Bromwich argues that academic skepticismThese movements in theoretical analysis are, however, alien to Trump, Bromwich wrote:In an essay in the London Review of Books last year, Bromwich provided insight into how Trump justifies his falsehoods. Bromwich cited a January 2017 ABC interview of Trump by the journalist David Muir, in which Muir repeatedly challenged Trump’s claim that Clinton only won the popular vote because three to five million illegal ballots were cast for her by undocumented immigrants and other noncitizens.In the transcript, Muir and Trump go back and forth for 1,168 words — an eternity on television — until Trump acknowledges how he justifies the claim: “You know what’s important, millions of people agree with me.” Trump told Muir that people called in to say, “ ‘We agree with Mr. Trump. We agree.’ They’re very smart people.”The Muir interview provides evidence in support of a thesis developed by Carlos Prado, professor emeritus of philosophy at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Prado argues that instead of representing postmodernism, Trump embodies a very different phenomenon: “Post-Truth.”“Users of post-truth see themselves as expressing their opinions, but opinions that call for no verification, and in being their opinions, are on a par with anyone else’s opinions,” Prado writes in a forthcoming book, “The New Subjectivism”:Trump’s post-truths have drawn a conservative audience of American voters inured to lying. A majority of voters, 59 percent, in an April 2017 Washington Post-ABC News poll, agreed that the Trump administration “regularly makes false claims up,” but, in the same survey, 52 percent said news organizations “regularly produce false stories.” An October 2017 Politico/Morning Consult poll found that a plurality of voters, 46 percent, believe the media fabricate stories about Trump compared to 37 percent who say the media report accurately.“The criticism of postmodern theory as ‘anything goes relativism’ is a bum rap,” says John Caputo, emeritus professor of religion at Syracuse University:The problem with Trump, according to Caputo,Judith Butler, a professor of comparative literature and the founding director of the program of critical theory at the University of California, Berkeley, voiced disbelief thatAlong similar lines, Colin Koopman, a professor of philosophy at the University of Oregon, argued that what is disturbing about Trump is that “he does not value truth in the sense of offering justifications and reasons to those at whom he speaks or tweets.”As a result, Koopman continued in an email,If postmodernism does not account for Trump’s bludgeoning of the truth, what does? A field that provides insight into the Trump phenomenon is evolutionary theory.Steven Pinker, professor of psychology at Harvard and author of the forthcoming book “Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress,” emailed me his thoughts:Once tribalism becomes embedded in the political system, Pinker wrote,Don Symons, professor of anthropology emeritus at the University of California-Santa Barbara, made a similar point in an email:If tribalism has begun to supplant traditional partisanship, their argument suggests, lying in politics will metastasize as traditional constraints continue to fall by the wayside.Trump’s success, such as it is, has been to accelerate the ongoing transformation of traditional political competition into an atavistic struggle in which each side claims moral superiority and defines the opposition as evil.These developments have been unfolding for decades, but the 2016 election was a turning point that appears to have the potential to corrupt the system beyond repair. Trump is determined to leave the destruction of democratic procedure as his legacy. Instead of granting him the title of postmodernist, let’s say instead that Trump is a nihilist who seeks to trample, to trash, to blight, to break and to burn.
