James B. Comey’s coming book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” briefly jumped to No. 1 on Amazon’s best-seller list on Sunday, about a month before its publication date of April 17. The spike in preorders occurred a couple of days after the former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe was fired, prompting a string of tweets by President Trump in which he said Mr. McCabe was a “choirboy” next to Mr. Comey, whom he called “sanctimonious.”The early interest in “A Higher Loyalty” is comparable to the advance buzz for “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” Michael Wolff’s exposé of the current administration, which was published earlier this year. Mr. Wolff’s book also hit the top of the Amazon best-seller list before its release, and the publishing house and book sellers were unprepared for the demand.There appears to be an enormous appetite for books that give insight into the Trump White House. “Fire and Fury” has sold more than a million copies across all formats, and it remains at the top of The New York Times’s hardcover nonfiction best sellers list. It has been on the list for 10 weeks. Similarly, upon its release, “Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump” by Michael Isikoff and David Corn sold so quickly that Amazon temporarily shut down the buy button on the book’s page, according to Twelve, an imprint of Hachette Book Group and the book’s publisher, likely believing bots were manipulating the sales. It has sold 47,000 copies in its first week, and on Monday evening, it was right behind “A Higher Loyalty” on Amazon’s politics and social sciences best-seller list.Mr. Comey’s book dropped to No. 2 over all on Amazon on Monday, it was replaced with “A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo,” a parody book commissioned by John Oliver based on a picture book about the Pence family’s real-life rabbit, which was written by Mr. Pence’s daughter. Macmillan, which owns Flatiron Books, declined to comment on preorders but confirmed an initial printing of 450,000. Mr. Comey stoked anticipation for “A Higher Loyalty” by responding to Mr. Trump’s tweets on Sunday. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not,” he said. In a statement, Macmillan said the book would “explore what good, ethical leadership looks like.”
