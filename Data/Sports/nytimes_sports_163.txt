To the Editor:Re “Officials to Lay a $1 Billion Fine on Wells Fargo” (front page, April 20) and “Just Deserts, or Just Cruel?,” by James B. Stewart (Common Sense column, Business Day, April 20):Mr. Stewart wonders: “Has Wells Fargo been punished enough?” It’s a public corporation that kept finding new ways to fraudulently separate people from their money. Two of the big bosses were let go and had a portion of their hundred-million-plus in deferred compensation and stock clawed back. Many underlings were let go. But they essentially robbed millions of dollars from people. And nobody went to jail.Why is a bank with a culture of blatant robbery even allowed to continue to function? Why haven’t board members been sued or otherwise separated from more than just a fraction of what they made? What will persuade boards to have effective safeguards against this sort of behavior?For once, Mr. Trump is doing the right thing by urging harsh penalties.PETER SMITHSANTA BARBARA, CALIF.
