Last week we asked students to post suggested topics for a writing prompt, and Xander Kruvczuk from the United States of America  did:Now, it later turned out that Kanye did not lose 10 million followers, but we loved the idea in general. This week it became the question, “How Much Do a Celebrity’s Personal Beliefs Influence Your Opinion of Their Work?” Let us, and Xander, know what you think.And if you have ideas for a writing prompt, we’ll be posting a new one every school day from now through early June, so please let us know.But if you’ve been participating in our forums all year, it’s time to step up your game. We’ve just announced our Ninth Annual New York Times Summer Reading Contest, and we hope you’ll join us.It runs for 10 weeks, from June 15 to Aug. 24, and all you have to do to enter is just answer the question, “What interested you most in The Times this week?”As we do here, we’ll choose favorites every week ... except in the summer we ask journalists from around the newsroom to help, and we crown just one top winner every Tuesday (though we also recognize many runners-up and honorable mentions). So if you’ve been feeling hemmed in by waiting to see what articles we choose, now’s your chance to choose your own.Now, enjoy this week’s selection.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted._________Our most popular prompt, “Is School a Place for Self-Expression?,” asked teenagers how much they reveal about their true selves in their work for teachers.
