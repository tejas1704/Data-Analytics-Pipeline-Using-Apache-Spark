More than any president in living memory, Donald Trump has conducted a dogged, remorseless assault on the press. He portrays the news media not only as a dedicated adversary of his administration but of the entire body politic. These attacks have forced the media where it does not want to be, at the center of the political debate.Trump’s purpose is clear. He seeks to weaken an institution that serves to constrain the abusive exercise of executive authority. He has initiated a gladiatorial contest pitting the principle of freedom of the press against a principle of his own invention: freedom from the press.Trump has his media favorites, Fox News and other organizations that serve as approved public relations outlets, versus the “fake news,” meaning virtually everything else.Politicians have frequently questioned the neutrality and objectivity of specific journalists, their stories and their publications, but Trump has raised the stakes to a new level. He has described news organizations as “the enemy of the American people.” He has routinely called reporters “scum,” “slime,” “dishonest” and “disgusting.”In November, Trump proposed a contest to determine which network — Fox excluded — “is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!”The news media “have been incorporated into the political style of the governing party as fixed hate objects,” Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at N.Y.U., wrote in an email to me.Rosen observed that the history of right-wing attacks on the mediaThere is an underlying strategy to Trump’s critique of the media. Rosen continued:Trump has some built-in advantages in his war on the media. Confidence in the media was in decline long before Trump entered politics — a slide that reflected the rise in political polarization. Gallup reported in September 2017 that 37 percent of the public had a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the mass media, down from 53 percent in 1997. And Trump’s critique of the media reaches a highly receptive audience.An April 2017 Gallup survey found that by a margin of more than 2 to 1, the public said that the press favored one party over the other. Of those who said the media is partisan, 64 percent said that the media favors Democrats, and 22 percent said Republicans.The media, on the other hand, enters the fray with significant disadvantages.In a 2017 paper, “Enemy Construction and the Press,” RonNell Andersen Jones and Lisa Grow Sun, law professors at the University of Utah and Brigham Young University, argue that Trump’s goal is fundamentally malign:Insofar as Trump succeeds in “undercutting the watchdog, educator, and proxy functions of the press,” they write, itJones and Sun contend that in many respects, Trump is reminiscent of Richard M. Nixon:Unlike Trump, however, Nixon (like the country’s founders)Trump stands out, according to Jones and Sun, in that his administrationIn response to my email, Jones replied that “war has been declared, whether they (the media) like it or not.” She noted that the instincts of the pressI asked Jonathan Ladd, a professor of public policy and government at Georgetown, what strategies he thought the media should adopt to counter negative portrayals by conservatives.“The best way for the press to react to Trump’s undemocratic behavior is to continue trying to do their jobs the best they can,” Ladd wrote. “The press is not perfect, but Trump’s bad behavior doesn’t change what they need to do.”Ladd specifically warned against “reacting to Trump by becoming more crusadingly anti-Trump.”Trump has successfully “put the mainstream media in a difficult position,” according to Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago:In the long term, Stone suggested, we could begin to remedy this problem if we improved civic education and encouraged a stronger defense of the media by politicians, especially Republicans — a prospect about which he is not optimistic.Of the media itself, however, Stone wrote:Trump’s disdain for the First Amendment is an integral part of a much longer series of developments in which both parties have demonstrated a willingness to defy democratic norms, although the Republican Party has been in the forefront.In “Asymmetric Constitutional Hardball,” Joseph Fishkin and David E. Pozen, law professors at the University of Texas and Columbia, write:Fishkin and Pozen cite the work of Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, to define constitutional hardball as “political claims and practices”Republicans on the far right, in particular, Fishkin and Pozen write, have been willing to engage in constitutional hardball because they are drawn to “narratives of debasement and restoration,” which suggestThe severity of the liberal threat, in the eyes of these conservatives, justifies extreme steps to restore what they see as a besieged moral order.In an email, Fishkin wrote:In Fishkin’s view, Trump will do all he can to make the conflict between his party and the press “sharper and more intense, in the same way that he depends on and aims to intensify partisan polarization.”Pozen warned in an email:Pozen described Trump’s denunciation of the press as “the culmination of several decades of comparable attacks by media pundits, such as Rush Limbaugh” and he argues that Trump’s callsThe question is whether the news media can mount an effective check on the exercise of power when the media itself has become an object of hatred for a large segment of the electorate.Rosen of N.Y.U. notes the cross pressures on the news media:Rosen draws attention to a September 2017 article in The Atlantic, “Trump’s War Against the Media Isn’t a War: You need two sides for that,” which quotes Marty Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post: “We’re not at war; we’re at work.” Baron is right, but for those without any understanding of — or respect for — freedom of the press, first principles can be brushed aside without a second thought.
