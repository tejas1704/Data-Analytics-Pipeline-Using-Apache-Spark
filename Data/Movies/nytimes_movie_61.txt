“You’re telling me that the king of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof catsuit?” a C.I.A. agent (played by Martin Freeman) asks a black-market gun runner (Andy Serkis) in a TV spot for Marvel’s “Black Panther” that was broadcast during the college football national championship on Monday night. The 90-second spot features almost as much action as Alabama’s overtime win did, and even includes music by the game’s halftime-show headliner, Kendrick Lamar.In addition to Chadwick Boseman’s titular superhero, also known as T’Challa, the trailer includes scenes of the primary villain, Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, who reunited with his “Fruitvale Station” and “Creed” director, Ryan Coogler, for the new movie. “I hope you’re ready, bro,” Killmonger, an expatriate who tries to stage a coup in the fictional African country of Wakanda, warns T’Challa. “I’m just getting started.”There were also glimpses of Lupita Nyong’o (as T’Challa’s ex-lover, a spy), Danai Gurira (as his chief bodyguard), and Forest Whitaker (as an elder who warns him, “A war is coming”).“Long live the king,” proclaims the teaser, and Disney executives certainly hope that proves prophetic, as tickets have just gone on sale for “Black Panther.” It opens Feb. 16.
