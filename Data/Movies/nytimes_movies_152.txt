Dear Diary:The elevators at 510 Madison Avenue are filled with what seems like an endless stream of business executives, partners and C.E.O.s. I hope those who were riding in elevator B will forgive and forget.Before going to work, I did a killer workout. Afterward, I may have had too many endorphins running through my system, because I went spray happy with my favorite perfume before leaving the gym. I was a walking oil diffuser.The elevators are a stone’s throw away from the entrance to the gym. I swiped my ID card, elevator B opened and I walked into a metal box with five businessmen.I couldn’t hide in a corner of the elevator, but had to stand right in the middle with a light blasting me from above.The men in the elevator sniffled and grunted. I felt the daggers. The sniffling and grunting got worse. It felt like the longest elevator ride of my life.When the doors opened I wanted to apologize, but instead I held my head high and walked right out. I heard the whispers as the doors shut behind me.I think I’ll use a little less tomorrow.
