The issue of sexual misconduct has emerged as a centerpiece of Democratic strategy for taking on President Trump and the Republican Party. That strategy paid off on Tuesday with the defeat of Roy Moore.Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s decision to bring to center stage charges of sexual harassment leveled by more than a dozen women against Trump has forced the White House onto the defensive.The story so far:On Sunday, Nikki Haley, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, broke ranks with the administration, telling John Dickerson on “Face the Nation” that Trump’s accusers “should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with.” Haley added that she is “incredibly proud of the women who have come forward” in all the recent cases of alleged harassment.On Monday, three of Trump’s accusers appeared on NBC Today with Megyn Kelly, following the publication of articles further chronicling Trump’s alleged misconduct in People, The New Yorker, The Atlantic and New York magazine. The liberal filmmaker, Robert Greenwald, released a documentary, “16 Women and Donald Trump: Hear Their Stories.”All of these developments are taking place against the backdrop of a pending defamation lawsuit against Trump, who awaits the decision of Jennifer G. Schecter — a New York state judge — who is considering a motion to require Trump to testify under oath in a lawsuit brought by Summer Zervos, a former “Apprentice” contestant.Zervos, who is represented by Gloria Allred, claims that in 2007 Trump “kissed her on the mouth repeatedly, touched her breast and pressed his genitals against her,” without her consent. Zervos contends that she was defamed when Trump dismissed her claims during the campaign as “lies” and “nonsense.”Since the first week of October, when The Times wrote about Harvey Weinstein’s pattern of sexual abuse, the floodwaters have been rising. At least 51 prominent men have been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from groping to rape. The accused — many of them abruptly removed from their positions — run the ideological and partisan gamut from Garrison Keillor to Leon Wieseltier to John Conyers to Matt Lauer to James Levine to Trent Franks to Al Franken to Charlie Rose and on and on, including, most recently, Mario Batali and Russell Simmons.For Democrats, who have struggled to find traction in their battles with the administration, the explosion of allegations has created an opening to put the focus on Trump — a development greatly enhanced by the Moore debacle.Among Democrats, Gillibrand stands out as the politician who first claimed ownership of the issue, and she is seen by many analysts and commentators as having moved into the front ranks of potential presidential candidates. But what Gillibrand started has become a broader movement encompassing almost the entire Democratic Senate caucus.After initiating the call on Franken to resign his seat, Gillibrand swiftly received remarkably strong support from her colleagues: 32 fellow Democratic senators and the two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats. There seemed to be an emerging consensus with a basic chess tactic: Sometimes you are required to sacrifice a pawn to checkmate the king.In other words, Democrats smell blood, Trump’s blood.Gillibrand now says that Bill Clinton, one of her most steadfast supporters, should have resigned the presidency after his affair with Monica Lewinsky was revealed, and on Monday Gillibrand told CNN that Trump should leave office in the face of “very credible allegations of misconduct and criminal activity.”“I think when we start having to talk about the differences between sexual assault and sexual harassment and unwanted groping, you are having the wrong conversation,” Gillibrand asserted at a news conference on Dec. 6. “You need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is O.K. None of it is acceptable.”Gillibrand continued:On Wednesday, Trump did Gillibrand a favor, tweeting:USA Today, a publication known for the moderation and balance of its commentary, promptly editorialized:Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on political rhetoric who is the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Ashley Parker of the Washington Post that“In the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape, he says, ‘You can do anything,’ and in the tweet attacking Gillibrand, he says, she ‘would do anything’,” Jamieson said:One of the strongest arguments in favor of a no-exceptions policy is that if Democrats want to capitalize on the surge of support for the #MeToo movement — and to make use of these issues against Trump and the likes of Roy Moore — they must have clean hands.On Dec. 7, the Pew Research Center released results showing that in our highly polarized era, there is widespread bipartisan concern over sexual harassment, as the accompanying chart shows.Abby K. Wood, a professor of law, political science and public policy at the University of Southern California, made the following case in an email:Jennifer Lawless, a political scientist at American University, agreed on most points with Wood. In an email, she wrote:Not only can Democrats claim the moral high ground, Lawless argued, but theyNot every supporter of zero tolerance is convinced that it will help win over wavering Republican voters.Samara Klar, a professor of government and public policy at the University of Arizona, wrote by email that the attitudes of Republican women suggest deep partisan distrust of all things Democratic. Exit polls in Alabama showed Moore winning among white women by 29 percentage points, and carrying white women with college degrees by 7 points, although it is worth noting, as the veteran Republican operative Matthew Dowd did, that “when you break out evangelical vs non you get evangelical white women 76-22 Moore; non-evangelical white women 74-21 Jones!”Nonetheless, Klar’s research shows that:Klar’s conclusion:Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver, noted thatThe other big plus for Democrats, according to Masket, is that the sexual harassment issue has put the Republican Party in the position ofChristina Wolbrecht, a political scientist at Notre Dame, made the case in an email that inaction on Franken on the part of Democrats could have had a severe negative impact:Still, there is a wide range of opinion on issues of sexual behavior within liberal ranks, including Emily Yoffe writing in Politico, Robert Kuttner writing in the American Prospect and Paul Rosenberg in Salon.In her essay, “Why the #MeToo Moment Should Be Ready for a Backlash,” Yoffe wrote:“Shame on the Democrats for this stampede,” Kuttner wrote:Rosenberg, in turn, declared that aIn the heat of this intra-Democratic debate, some detect the potential for what they see as a more nuanced approach to the problem.Elizabeth Bartholet, the director of the child advocacy program and a professor at Harvard Law School, who is no fan of Donald Trump, wrote in an email:Bartholet argued that when the posture of Democratic senators is examinedIn a phone interview, Bartholet noted the dangerSince hierarchical relationships are pervasive in these environments, Bartholet argues, there is a need alsoBartholet has been one of the leading critics of the sexual harassment policies now adopted by Harvard and many other colleges and universities. In October 2014, she and 27 other members of the Harvard Law School faculty published a letter in the Boston Globe that challenged the university’s harassment policy on a wide range of points. Some of those points are relevant to the current national debate over Franken and other accused politicians:With both political parties coming to realize that the issue of sexual harassment and misconduct may determine who is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021, the goal of “balanced” interests will be superseded, at least temporarily, by exigent political considerations.As Slate noted earlier this year, the Zervos defamation lawsuit “is daring Trump to incriminate himself in court” and to fall into the same perjury trap Bill Clinton did in the Paula Jones case — perjury which led to Clinton’s impeachment. And if Democrats retake either the House or the Senate in 2018, it is a virtual certainty that Trump’s accusers will be called to provide sworn testimony, and that the perjury trap will loom again if and when Trump is offered the opportunity to rebut them under oath.Democrats go into 2018 with the deck stacked against them — in the House by a combination of gerrymandering and the concentration of Democratic voters in relatively few districts and in the Senate, by the fact that 23 Democratic seats are up, along with those of the 2 independents who caucus with the Democrats, compared to only 8 Republican seats. Ten of the Democratic seats are in states carried by Trump.Insofar as sexual harassment and misconduct become an electoral issue, it will help the Democrats, but the party cannot depend on that alone to produce a change in control of either branch of Congress. No one knows what the half life of this issue is. Although right now it seems unlikely, it could once again become nearly as invisible as it was three months ago. At the moment, the Democrats’ best ally in building the momentum necessary for a power shift is Trump himself, who has been doing all he can to create the next Democratic wave.
